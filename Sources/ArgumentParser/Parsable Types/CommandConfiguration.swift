  ///     the name of the command type to hyphen-separated lowercase words.
  ///   - abstract: A one-line description of the command.
  ///   - usage: A custom usage description for the command. When you provide
  ///     a non-`nil` string, the argument parser uses `usage` instead of
  ///     automatically generating a usage description. Passing an empty string
  ///     hides the usage string altogether.
  ///   - discussion: A longer description of the command.
  ///   - version: The version number for this command. When you provide a
  ///     non-empty string, the argument parser prints it if the user provides
  ///     a `--version` flag.
  ///   - shouldDisplay: A Boolean value indicating whether the command
  ///     should be shown in the extended help display.
  ///   - ungroupedSubcommands: An array of the types that define subcommands
  ///     for the command that are not part of any command group.
  ///   - groupedSubcommands: An array of command groups, each of which defines
  ///     subcommands that are part of that logical group.
  ///   - defaultSubcommand: The default command type to run if no subcommand
  ///     is given.
  ///   - helpNames: The flag names to use for requesting help, when combined
  ///     with a simulated Boolean property named `help`. If `helpNames` is
  ///     `nil`, the names are inherited from the parent command, if any, or
  ///     are `-h` and `--help`.
  ///   - aliases: An array of aliases for the command's name. All of the aliases
  ///     MUST not match the actual command name, whether that be the derived name
  ///     if `commandName` is not provided, or `commandName` itself if provided.
