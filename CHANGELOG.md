### Additions

- Access the state of an ancestor command using the new `@ParentCommand` property wrapper. ([#802])

### Fixes

- Corrects the help display for an case iterable option value type. ([#821])
- Fixes ArgumentParser build failure for WASI (WebAssembly System Interface). ([#794])
- Updates help text for readability in Repeat example and README. ([#787])
- Provides an ambiguity breaker for some `ExpressibleByArgument` types. ([#841])
- Shell completion script fixes. ([#801], [#808], [#811])

### Changes

- `docc`: Updates the output to present the string representation of command arguments as a wrapped text block. ([#791])
- Uses Foundation Essentials when possible to reduce binary size on non-Darwin platforms. ([#804])
- CMake: Suppress needlessly alarming messages. ([#628])

The 1.7.0 release includes contributions from [bkhouri], [cmcgee1024], [dabrahams], [heckj], [incertum], [kkebo], [Konstantin-Krokhin], [natecook1000], [rauhul], [rgoldberg], and [tshortli]. Thank you!

---

## [1.6.2] - 2025-10-01

### Fixes

- Fixes an ArgumentParser build failure for WASI. ([#794])

## [1.6.1] - 2025-07-01

### Fixes

- Resolves a source break for clients that have conditional conformances
  to `ExpressibleByArgument` or `ParsableArguments`. ([#792])

## [1.6.0] - 2025-06-30

### Additions

- Options with `CaseIterable` types can now provide help descriptions on a per-value basis. ([#647])
- New API for accessing the shell and shell version while generating completions. ([#680], [#690])
- The `generate-docc-reference` plugin generates a DocC reference folder for your CLI tool. ([#694], [#754], [#773])

### Changes

- Testing and continuous integration improvements, including migrating to GitHub workflows.
  ([#692], [#693], [#696], [#698], [#699], [#700], [#701], [#708], [#711], [#718], [#716], [#714], [#712], [#732], [#730], [#746], [#747], [#760])
- The associated closure for `CompletionKind.custom` now takes three parameters: the array of shell words currently in use for the completion request, the offset in that array for the word that completions are being requested for, and the prefix of that word that precedes the cursor. In addition, the associated closure can be `async`. The single-argument closure version of `CompletionKind.custom` is deprecated with this release. ([#763], [#770], [#782])
- `ParsableArguments` and `ExpressibleByArgument` now conform to `SendableMetatype` when builing with a minimum Swift 6.2 compiler. ([#789])

### Fixes

- Significant fixes and improvements across the entire completion script generation system, too numerous to mention here.
  Please note: numerous longstanding issues still remain in the completion scripts (mainly involving quoting/escaping); they will be fixed over time.
  A special thanks to @rgoldberg for the investment in completion script quality!
  ([#727], [#735], [#738], [#740], [#762], [#763], [#775], [#770], [#777], [#767])

- Implementation improvements and fixes for both older and newer versions of Swift.
  ([#676], [#707], [#705], [#720], [#666], [#724], [#731], [#766], [#685], [#729], [#736], [#741])
- Better capturing of tool configuration in `ToolInfo`. ([#669], [#697])
- Documentation improvements. ([#657], [#678], [#743])

The 1.6.0 release includes contributions from [bripeticca], [cg-soft], [compnerd],
[dshan4585], [heckj], [natecook1000], [rauhul], [rgoldberg], and [Steelskin].
Thank you!

---

## [1.5.1] - 2025-05-28

### Fixes

- Relax the CMake build system to allow implicit linking of Foundation and XCTest
  when not explicitly given the associated build tree. ([#783])

The 1.5.1 release includes a contribution from [compnerd]. Thank you!

## [1.5.0] - 2024-07-18

### Additions

- Subcommands can now be grouped into sections to enable a better help display
  for commands with many subcommands. ([#644])
- Improved unofficial support for Android and riscv64 platforms. ([#649], [#651])

### Fixes

- Command-line completion scripts correctly complete for arguments that are
  included via option group. ([#648])
- Several warnings when compiling with strict concurrency enabled, or in Swift
  6 language mode, are now silenced. ([#650])

The 1.5.0 release includes contributions from [CraigSiemens], [DougGregor],
[finagolfin], [futurejones], and [natecook1000]. Thank you!

---

## [1.4.0] - 2024-05-21

### Additions

- Adds support for subcommand aliases via a new `CommandConfiguration.aliases`
  parameter. Aliases are shown in help text and used during command parsing. For
  example, a subcommand like "average" from the example "math" tool can be
  defined with the aliases `["avg"]`. The resulting subcommand can now be
  invoked with either of `math stats average` and ``math stats avg`. See the
  updated documentation and example for additional details. ([#627])
- Adds a new API `usageString` to `ParsableArguments` and `ParsableCommand` for
  retrieving their usage text, allowing for more flexible construction of error
  screens. ([#634])
- Adds support for passing custom arguments to `AsyncParsableCommand.main()`
  with a new `static func main(_ arguments: [String]?) async` method. ([#568])

### Fixes

- Removes default parameter values from deprecated CommandConfiguration
  initializers to prevent them from being selected as overloads. Some niche
  invalid deprecation warnings should no longer occur. ([#636])

The 1.4.0 release includes contributions from [Austinpayne], [dcantah],
[KS1019], [natecook1000], [rauhul], and [revolter]. Thank you!

## [1.3.1] - 2024-03-16

### Changes

- The `CommandConfiguration` type is now designated as `Sendable`. ([#615])
- The library uses `internal` imports instead of `@_implementationOnly` annotations
  in Swift versions where permitted. ([#616])

### Fixes

- `@Option`- and `@Argument`-annotated optional properties that use a `transform` closure
  for parsing can now be declared without ambiguity. ([#619])

- The help flag is now recognized more consistently when a default subcommand has been
  specified. ([#612])

- Options that use the `.upToNextOption` parsing strategy can now recognize an attached
  value (e.g. `--numbers=1 2 3`). ([#610])

- Generated completion scripts for `zsh` handle repeatable options correctly. ([#614])

- Documentation improvements and clarifications. ([#607], [#611], [#617], [#621])

- Build improvements for CMake builds. ([#606], [#608])

The 1.3.1 release includes contributions from [Coeur], [compnerd], [keith], [MaxDesiatov],
[mayoff], and [natecook1000]. Thank you!

## [1.3.0] - 2023-12-06

### Changes

- The `@Option`, `@Argument`, `@Flag`, and `@OptionGroup` property wrappers now
  conditionally conform to `Sendable` when the wrapper's `Value` type conforms. With this
  change, you can mark `ParsableCommand` types as `Sendable` when you want to be able to
  pass a parsed command across concurrent contexts. ([#582])

  *Migration:* Users that aren't ready to resolve sendability warnings can add the
  `@preconcurrency` attribute to `import ArgumentParser` statements.

  As part of this update, changes to the `CommandLine.arguments` array before a command's
  `main` or `parse...` methods are called are no longer observed. Instead of making
  changes to `CommandLine.arguments`, pass an updated array of arguments to the command's
  method.

- To support migration to `Sendable` annotation, the minimum Swift version for
  `swift-argument-parser` has been increased to Swift 5.7. Users of older Swift versions
  will be able to continue using version 1.2.3 of the library. ([#582])

### Additions

- Help screens now include possible options for `ExpressibleByArgument` types
  with non-empty `allValueStrings`. Types also conforming to `CaseIterable` do
  not need to manually implement `allValueStrings`, instead it is derived from
  `allCases`. ([#594])

### Fixes

- The titles for nested option groups are preserved when embedded into commands without
  specifying a new title. ([#592])
- When wrapping help and error messages, the library now uses the `COLUMNS` environment
  variable when set, instead of immediately falling back to 80 columns. ([#596])
- Bash completion scripts now respect the extensions given in a `.file(...)` completion
  kind. ([#590])
- Bash completion scripts now properly escape command names that include hyphens. ([#573])
- Documentation improvements. ([#572], [#565], [#602])

The 1.3.0 release includes contributions from [Alkenso], [compnerd], [gwynne],
[kennyyork], [natecook1000], [rauhul], [robertmryan], and [vlm]. Thank you!

---

## [1.2.3] - 2023-08-15

### Additions

- You can now use ArgumentParser with Musl libc. ([#574])

### Fixes

- Fixes a bug where single-page manuals did not include command abstracts for
  subcommands. ([#552])
- Fixes a bug where non-optional properties in ParsableCommands could cause
  ArgumentParser to crash. You can now include properties like dictionaries in
  ParsableCommands without issue. ([#554])
- Fixes a configuration issue which would cause `ArgumentParserTestHelpers` to
  fail to link when building for Windows. ([#579])

The 1.2.3 release includes contributions from [compnerd], [gwynne],
[MaxDesiatov], [natecook1000], and [rauhul]. Thank you!

## [1.2.2] - 2023-02-09

### Fixes

- Arguments with the `.allUnrecognized` parsing strategy no longer consume
  built-in flags like `--help` and `--version`. ([#550])
- Fixes an issue introduced in version 1.2.0 where properties with underscored
  names couldn't be parsed. ([#548])
- Improves the error message for cases where platform availability causes the
  synchronous `ParsableCommand.main()` static method to be run on an
  `AsyncParsableCommand` type. ([#547])

## [1.2.1] - 2023-01-12

### Changes

- Documentation is now primarily hosted at the
  [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-argument-parser).

### Fixes

- `exit(_:)` no longer causes infinite recursion on the WASI platform. ([#520])
- Completion scripts for `fish` now provide completions after a
  non-hyphen-prefixed argument has been provided. ([#535])
- Overload selection for custom `ExpressibleByArgument` types has been improved.
  ([#522])
- The usage string for `.postTerminator` arguments now includes the required
  terminator (`--`). ([#542])
- Documentation and testing fixes and improvements.

The 1.2.1 release includes contributions from [Chamepp], [kkk669], [mtj0928],
[natecook1000], [rauhul], [rickrizzo], [TiagoMaiaL], and [yim-lee]. Thank you!

## [1.2.0] - 2022-11-08

### Additions

- You can now provide a title in an `@OptionGroup` declaration. Titled option
  groups are listed separately in the help screen under that title as a
  heading. ([#492])
- Two new parsing strategies have been added for `@Argument` array properties:

  - `.allUnrecognized` captures all unrecognized inputs after parsing known
    flags, options, and arguments.
	- `.postTerminator` collects any inputs that follow the `--` terminator.

  See the [`ArgumentArrayParsingStrategy` documentation][arrayparse-docs] for
  more. ([#496])
- Default values are now supported for `@Argument` or `@Option` properties with
  optional type, allowing you to initialize those properties with `nil`.
  Providing a non-`nil` default value results in a warning, since optional
  properties with non-`nil` defaults don't need to be declared as optionals.
  ([#477], [#480])

### Changes

- The `.unconditionalRemaining` array parsing strategy has been deprecated and
  renamed to `.captureForPassthrough`, to better fit its semantic behavior and
  intended usage. See the [`ArgumentArrayParsingStrategy`
  documentation][arrayparse-docs] for more. ([#496])

### Fixes

- Invalid `init(from:)` decoding initializers are now correctly diagnosed by
  ArgumentParser's validators. ([#487])
- Default values are now correctly displayed as flags for `@Flag` properties
  with inversions or `EnumerableFlag` types. ([#486])
- The help display for non-string-backed raw representable types has been
  corrected to not show raw Swift values. Instead, the help display uses the
  type's customized `defaultValueDescription` and `allValues` implementations.
  ([#494])
- Properties at different levels of a command hierarchy with the same Swift name
  but different argument names no longer collide. ([#495])
- The `generate-manual` plugin name is improved when used from within Xcode.
  ([#505])
- Documentation fixes and improvements.

The 1.2.0 release includes contributions from [allevato], [clayellis],
[compnerd], [d-ronnqvist], [natecook1000], [randomeizer], and [rauhul].
Thank you!

## [1.1.4] - 2022-08-26

### Changes

- The generate-manual plugin now defaults to creating single-page manuals. The
  `--single-page` flag has been replaced with `--multi-page` to restore the
  previous default functionality. ([#472])

  *Migration:* Update scripts that invoked generate-manual without
  `--single-page` to include `--multi-page` and update scripts that invoked
  generate-manual with `--single-page` to omit the flag.

- The "experimental" prefix from the generate-manual plugin has been removed.
  ([#475])

  *Migration:* Update scripts to invoke the generate-manual plugin via
  `swift package generate-manual` instead of
  `swift package plugin experimental-generate-manual`.

### Fixes

- The generate-manual plugin is correctly declared as a product, making the
  plugin visible to clients. ([#456])
- The generate-manual plugin's `--authors` arguments are now correctly passed to
  the underlying generation tool. ([#471])
- Manuals generated by the generate-manual plugin now include the option's value
  names and do not include value names for flags. ([#473])
- Built-in flags such as `--help` and `--version` are now correctly marked as
  optional, fixing some generated content that indicated the flags are always
  required. ([#474])
- Value descriptions are now correctly derived for types which are
  `ExpressibleByArgument` and `RawRepresentable` by `String`. Help menus will
  now display valid default values for such types. ([#476])

The 1.1.4 release includes contributions from [ian-twilightcoder],
[MarcoEidinger], and [rauhul]. Thank you!

## [1.1.3] - 2022-06-23

### Additions

- `ArgumentParser` now includes a SwiftPM plugin for generating `man` pages.
  Explore the functionality and configuration by running
  `swift package plugin experimental-generate-manual --help` from your package
  root. ([#332])

### Fixes

- Hidden subcommands are now excluded from completion scripts. ([#443])
- When an invalid value is provided for a `CaseIterable` type, the error message
  now includes a list of valid inputs. ([#445])
- There's now a diagnostic when an `AsyncParsableCommand` is incorrectly placed
  under a non-`async` root command. ([#436])

The 1.1.3 release includes contributions from [keith], [KeithBird],
[konomae], [LucianoPAlmeida], and [rauhul]. Thank you!

## [1.1.2] - 2022-04-11

### Changes

- CMake builds now always statically links `ArgumentParserToolInfo`.
  ([#424])

### Fixes

- When a user provides an array-based option's key (e.g. `--key`)
  without any values, the error message now correctly describes the
  problem. ([#435])

The 1.1.2 release includes contributions from [compnerd] and [KeithBird].
Thank you!

## [1.1.1] - 2022-03-16

### Fixes

- Moves the platform requirement from the package level down to the new
  types and protocols with `async` members. This was a source-breaking
  change in 1.1.0. ([#427])
- Fixed issues in the CMake build configuration.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-03-14

### Additions

- A command's `run()` method now supports `async`/`await` when the command
  conforms to `AsyncParsableCommand`. ([#404])
- New API for distinguishing between public, hidden, and private arguments
  and option groups, and a new extended help screen accessible via
  `--help-hidden`. ([#366], [#390], and [#405 through #413][1.1.0])
- You can now override the autogenerated usage string when configuring a
  command. ([#400])

### Changes

- `ArgumentParser` now requires Swift 5.5.

### Fixes

- The auto-generated usage string now correctly hides all optional parameters
  when over the length limit. ([#416])
- One `@Option` initializer now has its parameters in the correct order; the
  incorrect initializer is deprecated. ([#391])
- Help flags are now correctly captured in `.unconditionalRemaining` argument
  arrays.
- Documentation fixes and improvements.

The 1.1.0 release includes contributions from [keith], [MartinP7r], [McNight],
[natecook1000], [rauhul], and [zkiraly]. Thank you!

---

## [1.0.3] - 2022-01-31

### Changes

- When a user provides an incorrect value for an option, an
  `ArgumentParser`-based program now includes the valid values when possible.

    ```
    $ example --format png
    Error: The value 'png' is invalid for '--format <format>'.
    Please provide one of 'text', 'json' or 'csv'.
    ```

### Fixes

- Resolves an issue with `zsh` custom completions for command names that include
  a dash.
- Improves the generated completions scripts for `fish`.
- Resolves issues that prevented building `ArgumentParser` for WebAssembly using
  SwiftWasm toolchains.
- Improved window size handling on Windows.
- Fixed a crash when using `--experimental-dump-help` with commands that provide
  non-parsed values.
- Fixes an issue where subcommands that declare array arguments with the
  `.unconditionalRemaining` parsing strategy unexpectedly miss arguments,
  extending the change in [#333] to subcommands. ([#397])
- Corrects the order of an `@Option` initializer's parameters, deprecating the
  old version. ([#391])
- Expanded and corrected documentation.

The 1.0.3 release includes contributions from [atierian], [CraigSiemens],
[dduan], [floam], [KS1019], [McNight], [mdznr], [natecook1000], [rauhul], and
[yonihemi]. Thank you!


## [1.0.2] - 2021-11-09

### Fixes

- Addresses an issue when building tests under Mac Catalyst.

The 1.0.2 release includes a contribution from [jakepetroules]. Thank you!

## [1.0.1] - 2021-09-14

### Fixes

- Addresses an issue when compiling under Mac Catalyst.

The 1.0.1 release includes a contribution from [imxieyi]. Thank you!

## [1.0.0] - 2021-09-10

The 1.0 release marks an important milestone —
`ArgumentParser` is now source stable!

### Changes

- `ArgumentParser` now provides a DocC documentation catalog, so you
  can view rendered articles and symbol documentation directly within
  Xcode.

### Fixes

- Parsing works as expected for options with single-dash names that
  are declared using the `.upToNextOption` parsing strategy.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2021-09-02

### Additions

- When a user doesn't provide a required argument, the error message now
  includes that argument's help text. ([#324])
- Command-line tools built with `ArgumentParser` now include an experimental
  flag to dump command/argument/help information as JSON:
  `--experimental-dump-help`. ([#310])

### Changes

- All public enumerations are now structs with static properties, to make
  compatibility with future additions simpler.

### Fixes

- Array properties defined as `@Option` with the `.upToNextOption` parsing
  strategy now include all provided values. ([#304]) In the example below, all
  four values are now included in the resulting array, where only the last two
  were included in previous releases:

    ```swift
    struct Example: ParsableCommand {
        @Option(parsing: .upToNextOption)
        var option: [String]
    }
    ```
    ```
    $ example --option one two --option three four
    ```

- When a command defines an array property as an `@Argument` with the
  `.unconditionalRemaining` parsing strategy, option and flag parsing now stops
  at the first positional argument or unrecognized flag. ([#333])
- Completion scripts correctly use customized help flags. ([#308])
- Fixes errors with bash custom completion arguments and the executable path.
  ([#320], [#323])
- Fixes the behavior when a user specifies both the `help` subcommand and a help
  flag. ([#309])
- A variety of internal improvements. ([#315], [#316], [#321], [#341])

The 0.5.0 release includes contributions from [atierian], [compnerd],
[dirtyhabits97], [Frizlab], [KS1019], [natecook1000], and [rauhul]. Thank you!

---

## [0.4.4] - 2021-07-30

### Fixes

- Includes a workaround for a runtime crash with certain `OptionGroup`
  configurations when a command is compiled in release mode.

## [0.4.3] - 2021-04-28

### Additions

- Experimental API for hiding `@OptionGroup`-declared properties from
  the help screen.

The 0.4.3 release includes a contribution from [miggs597]. Thank you!

## [0.4.2] - 2021-04-21

### Fixes

- Both parts of a flag with an inversion are now hidden when specified.
- Better support for building on OpenBSD.
- Optional unparsed values are now always properly decoded. ([#290])
- Help information from super-commands is no longer unnecessarily injected
  into subcommand help screens.

The 0.4.2 release includes contributions from [3405691582], [kylemacomber],
[miggs597], [natecook1000], and [werm098]. Thank you!

## [0.4.1] - 2021-03-08

### Additions

- When a user provides an invalid value as an argument or option, the error
  message now includes the help text for that argument.

### Fixes

- Zsh completion scripts for commands that include a hyphen no longer cause
  errors.
- Optional unparsed values are now decoded correctly in `ParsableArguments`
  types.

The 0.4.1 release includes contributions from [adellibovi] and [natecook1000].
Thank you!

## [0.4.0] - 2021-03-04

### Additions

- Short options can now support "joined option" syntax, which lets users specify
  a value appended immediately after the option's short name. For example, in
  addition to calling this `example` command with `-D debug` and `-D=debug`,
  users can now write `-Ddebug` for the same parsed value. ([#240])

  ```swift
  @main
  struct Example: ParsableCommand {
      @Option(name: .customShort("D", allowingJoined: true))
      var debugValue: String

      func run() {
          print(debugValue)
      }
  }
  ```

### Changes

- The `CommandConfiguration.helpNames` property is now optional, to allow the
  overridden help flags of parent commands to flow down to their children. Most
  existing code should not be affected, but if you've customized a command's
  help flags, you may see different behavior. ([#251])
- The `errorCode` property is no longer used as a command's exit code when
  `CustomNSError` types are thrown. ([#276])

  *Migration:* Instead of throwing a `CustomNSError` type, print your error
  manually and throw an `ExitCode` error to customize your command's exit code.

### Removals

- Old, deprecated property wrapper initializers have been removed.

### Fixes

- Validation errors now show the correct help flags when help flags have been
  customized.
- Options, flags, and arguments that are marked as hidden from the help screen
  are also suppressed from completion scripts.
- Non-parsed variable properties are now allowed in parsable types.
- Error messages produced when `NSError` types are thrown have been improved.
- The usage line for commands with a large number of options includes more
  detail about required flags and positional arguments.
- Support for CMake builds on Apple Silicon is improved.

The 0.4.0 release includes contributions from [CodaFi], [lorentey],
[natecook1000], [schlagelk], and [Zoha131]. Thank you!

---

## [0.3.2] - 2021-01-15

### Fixes

- Changes made to a command's properties in its `validate` method are now
  persisted.
- The exit code defined by error types that conform to `CustomNSError` are now
  honored.
- Improved error message when declaring a command type with an unadorned
  mutable property. (See [#256] for more.)
- Migrated from `CRT` to `MSVCRT` for Windows platforms.
- Fixes and improvements for building with CMake for Windows and Apple Silicon.
- Documentation improvements.

The 0.3.2 release includes contributions from [compnerd], [CypherPoet],
[damuellen], [drewmccormack], [elliottwilliams], [gmittert], [MaxDesiatov],
[natecook1000], [pegasuze], and [SergeyPetrachkov]. Thank you!

## [0.3.1] - 2020-09-02

### Fixes

- An option or flag can now declare a name with both single- and double-dash
  prefixes, such as `-my-flag` and `--my-flag`. Specify both names in the
  `name` parameter when declaring your property:

  ```swift
  @Flag(name: [.long, .customLong("my-flag", withSingleDash: true)])
  var myFlag = false
  ```

- Parsing performance improvements.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-08-15

### Additions

- Shell completion scripts are now available for Fish.

### Changes

- Array properties without a default value are now treated as required for the
  user of a command-line tool. In previous versions of the library, these
  properties defaulted to an empty array; a deprecation was introduced for this
  behavior in version 0.2.0.

  *Migration:* Specify an empty array as the default value for properties that
  should not require user input:

  ```swift
  // old
  @Option var names: [String]
  // new
  @Option var names: [String] = []
  ```

The 0.3.0 release includes contributions from [dduan], [MPLew-is],
[natecook1000], and [thomasvl]. Thank you!

---

## [0.2.2] - 2020-08-05

### Fixes

- Zsh completion scripts have improved documentation and better support
  multi-word completion strings, escaped characters, non-standard executable
  locations, and empty help strings.

The 0.2.2 release includes contributions from [interstateone],
[miguelangel-dev], [natecook1000], [stuartcarnie], and [Wevah]. Thank you!

## [0.2.1] - 2020-07-30

### Additions

- You can now generate Bash and Zsh shell completion scripts for commands,
  either by using the `--generate-completion-script` flag when running a
  command, or by calling the static `completionScript(for:)` method on a root
  `ParsableCommand` type. See the [guide to completion scripts][comp-guide] for
  information on customizing and installing the completion script for your
  command.

### Fixes

- Property wrappers without parameters can now be written without parentheses
  — e.g. `@Flag var verbose = false`.
- When displaying default values for array properties, the help screen now
  correctly uses the element type's `ExpressibleByArgument` conformance to
  generate the description.
- Running a project that defines a command as its own subcommand now fails with
  a useful error message.

The 0.2.1 release includes contributions from [natecook1000], [NicFontana],
[schlagelk], [sharplet], and [Wevah]. Thank you!

## [0.2.0] - 2020-06-23

### Additions

- You can now specify default values for array properties of parsable types.
  The default values are overridden if the user provides at least one value
  as part of the command-line arguments.

### Changes

- This release of `swift-argument-parser` requires Swift 5.2.
- Default values for all properties are now written using default initialization
  syntax, including some values that were previously implicit, such as empty
  arrays and `false` for Boolean flags.

  *Migration:* Specify default values using typical Swift default value syntax
  to remove the deprecation warnings:

  ```swift
  // old
  @Flag var verbose: Bool
  // new
  @Flag var verbose = false
  ```

  **_Important:_** There is a semantic change for flags with inversions that do
  not have a default value. In previous releases, these flags had a default
  value of `false`; starting in 0.2.0, these flags will have no default, and
  will therefore be required by the user. Specify a default value of `false` to
  retain the old behavior.

### Fixes

- Options with multiple names now consistently show the first-declared name
  in usage and help screens.
- Default subcommands are indicated in the help screen.
- User errors with options are now shown before positional argument errors,
  eliminating some false negative reports.
- CMake compatibility fixes.

The 0.2.0 release includes contributions from [artemnovichkov], [compnerd],
[ibrahimoktay], [john-mueller], [MPLew-is], [natecook1000], and [owenv].
Thank you!

## [0.1.0] - 2020-06-03

### Additions

- Error messages and help screens now include information about how to request
  more help.
- CMake builds now support installation.

### Changes

- The `static func main()` method on `ParsableCommand` no longer returns
  `Never`. This allows `ParsableCommand` types to be designated as the entry
  point for a Swift executable by using the `@main` attribute.

  *Migration:* For most uses, this change is source compatible. If you have
  used `main()` where a `() -> Never` function is explicitly required, you'll
  need to change your usage or capture the method in another function.

- `Optional` no longer conforms to `ExpressibleByArgument`, to avoid some
  property declarations that don't make sense.

  *Migration:* This is source-compatible for all property declarations, with
  deprecations for optional properties that define an explicit default. If
  you're using optional values where an `ExpressibleByArgument` type is
  expected, such as a generic function, you will need to change your usage
  or provide an explicit override.

- `ParsableCommand`'s `run()` method requirement is now a `mutating` method,
  allowing mutations to a command's properties, such as sorting an array of
  arguments, without additional copying.

  *Migration:* No changes are required for commands that are executed through
  the `main()` method. If you manually parse a command and then call its
  `run()` method, you may need to change the command from a constant to a
  variable.

### Removals

- The `@Flag` initializers that were deprecated in version 0.0.6 are now
  marked as unavailable.

### Fixes

- `@Option` properties of an optional type that use a `transform` closure now
  correctly indicate their optionality in the usage string.
- Correct wrapping and indentation are maintained for abstracts and discussions
  with short lines.
- Empty abstracts no longer add extra blank lines to the help screen.
- Help requests are still honored even when a parsed command fails validation.
- The `--` terminator isn't consumed when parsing a command, so that it can be
  parsed as a value when a subcommand includes an `.unconditionalRemaining`
  argument array.
- CMake builds work correctly again.

The 0.1.0 release includes contributions from [aleksey-mashanov], [BradLarson],
[compnerd], [erica], [ibrahimoktay], and [natecook1000]. Thank you!

## [0.0.6] - 2020-05-14

### Additions

- Command definition validation now checks for name collisions between options
  and flags.
- `ValidationError.message` is now publicly accessible.
- Added an `EnumerableFlag` protocol for `CaseIterable` types that are used to
  provide the names for flags. When declaring conformance to `EnumerableFlag`,
  you can override the name specification and help text for individual flags.
  See [#65] for more detail.
- When a command that requires arguments is called with no arguments at all,
  the error message includes the full help text instead of the short usage
  string. This is intended to provide a better experience for first-time users.
- Added a `helpMessage()` method for generating the help text for a command
  or subcommand.

### Deprecations

- `@Flag` properties that use `CaseIterable`/`String` types as their values
  are deprecated, and the related `@Flag` initializers will be removed
  in a future version.

  *Migration:* Add `EnumerableFlag` conformance to the type of these kinds of
  `@Flag` properties.

### Fixes

- Errors thrown while parsing in a `transform` closure are printed correctly
  instead of a general `Invalid state` error.
- Improvements to the guides and in the error message when attempting to access
  a value from an argument/option/flag definition.
- Fixed issues in the CMake and Windows build configurations.
- You can now use an `=` to join a value with an option's short name when calling
  a command. This previously only worked for long names.

The 0.0.6 release includes contributions from [compnerd], [john-mueller],
[natecook1000], [owenv], [rjstelling], and [toddthomas]. Thank you!

## [0.0.5] - 2020-04-15

### Additions

- You can now specify a version string in a `ParsableCommand`'s configuration.
  The generated tool will then automatically respond to a `--version` flag.
- Command definitions are now validated at runtime in debug mode, to check
  issues that can't be detected during compilation.

### Fixes

- Deprecation warnings during compilation on Linux have been removed.
- The `validate()` method is now called on each command in the matched command
  stack, instead of only the last command in the stack.

The 0.0.5 release includes contributions from [kennyyork], [natecook1000],
[sgl0v], and [YuAo]. Thank you!

## [0.0.4] - 2020-03-23

### Fixes

- Removed usage of 5.2-only syntax.

## [0.0.3] - 2020-03-22

### Additions

- You can specify the `.unconditionalRemaining` parsing strategy for arrays of
  positional arguments to accept dash-prefixed input, like
  `example --one two -three`.
- You can now provide a default value for a positional argument.
- You can now customize the display of default values in the extended help for
  an `ExpressibleByArgument` type.
- You can call the static `exitCode(for:)` method on any command to retrieve the
  exit code for a given error.

### Fixes

- Supporting targets are now prefixed to prevent conflicts with other libraries.
- The extension providing `init?(argument:)` to `RawRepresentable` types is now
  properly constrained.
- The parser no longer treats passing the same exclusive flag more than once as
  an error.
- `ParsableArguments` types that are declared as `@OptionGroup` properties on
  commands can now also be declared on subcommands. Previously, the parent
  command's declaration would prevent subcommands from seeing the user-supplied
  arguments.
- Default values are rendered correctly for properties with `Optional` types.
- The output of help requests is now printed during the "exit" phase of execution,
  instead of during the "run" phase.
- Usage strings now correctly show that optional positional arguments aren't
  required.
- Extended help now omits extra line breaks when displaying arguments or commands
  with long names that don't provide help text.

The 0.0.3 release includes contributions from [compnerd], [elliottwilliams],
[glessard], [griffin-stewie], [iainsmith], [Lantua], [miguelangel-dev],
[natecook1000], [sjavora], and [YuAo]. Thank you!

## [0.0.2] - 2020-03-06

### Additions

- The `EX_USAGE` exit code is now used for validation errors.
- The parser provides near-miss suggestions when a user provides an unknown
  option.
- `ArgumentParser` now builds on Windows.
- You can throw an `ExitCode` error to exit without printing any output.
- You can now create optional Boolean flags with inversions that default to
  `nil`:
  ```swift
  @Flag(inversion: .prefixedNo) var takeMyShot: Bool?
  ```
- You can now specify exclusivity for case-iterable flags and for Boolean flags
  with inversions.

### Fixes

- Cleaned up a wide variety of documentation typos and shortcomings.
- Improved different kinds of error messages:
  - Duplicate exclusive flags now show the duplicated arguments.
  - Subcommand validation errors print the correct usage string.
- In the help screen:
  - Removed the extra space before the default value for arguments without
    descriptions.
  - Removed the default value note when the default value is an empty string.
  - Default values are now shown for Boolean options.
  - Case-iterable flags are now grouped correctly.
  - Case-iterable flags with default values now show the default value.
  - Arguments from parent commands that are included via `@OptionGroup` in
    subcommands are no longer duplicated.
- Case-iterable flags created with the `.chooseFirst` exclusivity parameter now
  correctly ignore additional flags.

The 0.0.2 release includes contributions from [AliSoftware], [buttaface],
[compnerd], [dduan], [glessard], [griffin-stewie], [IngmarStein],
[jonathanpenn], [klaaspieter], [natecook1000], [Sajjon], [sjavora],
[Wildchild9], and [zntfdr]. Thank you!

## [0.0.1] - 2020-02-27

- `ArgumentParser` initial release.
