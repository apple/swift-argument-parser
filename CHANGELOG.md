# CHANGELOG

<!-- 
Add new items at the end of the relevant section under **Unreleased**.
-->

This project follows semantic versioning. While still in major version `0`,
source-stability is only guaranteed within minor versions (e.g. between
`0.0.3` and `0.0.4`). If you want to guard against potentially source-breaking
package updates, you can specify your package dependency using
`.upToNextMinor(from: "0.0.1")` as the requirement.

## [Unreleased]

*No changes yet.*

## [0.0.6] - 2020-05-14

### Additions

- Command definition validation now checks for name collisions between options
  and flags.
- `ValidationError.message` is now publicly accessible.
- Added an `EnumerableFlag` protocol for `CaseIterable` types that are used to
  provide the names for flags. When declaring conformance to `EnumerableFlag`,
  you can override the name specification and help text for individual flags.
  See [#65] for more detail.
- When a command that requires arguments is called with no arguments at all, 
  the error message includes the full help text instead of the short usage
  string. This is intended to provide a better experience for first-time users.
- Added a `helpMessage()` method for generating the help text for a command
  or subcommand.

### Deprecations

- `@Flag` properties that use `CaseIterable`/`String` types as their values
  are deprecated, and the related `@Flag` initializers will be removed 
  in a future version. 
  
  *Migration:* Add `EnumerableFlag` conformance to the type of these kinds of
  `@Flag` properties.

### Fixes

- Errors thrown while parsing in a `transform` closure are printed correclty
  instead of a general `Invalid state` error.
- Improvements to the guides and in the error message when attempting to access
  a value from an argument/option/flag definition.
- Fixed issues in the CMake and Windows build configurations.
- You can now use an `=` to join a value with an option's short name when calling
  a command. This previously only worked for long names.

The 0.0.6 release includes contributions from [compnerd], [john-mueller], 
[natecook1000], [owenv], [rjstelling], and [toddthomas]. Thank you!

## [0.0.5] - 2020-04-15

### Additions

- You can now specify a version string in a `ParsableCommand`'s configuration.
  The generated tool will then automatically respond to a `--version` flag.
- Command definitions are now validated at runtime in debug mode, to check
  issues that can't be detected during compilation.

### Fixes

- Deprecation warnings during compilation on Linux have been removed.
- The `validate()` method is now called on each command in the matched command
  stack, instead of only the last command in the stack.

The 0.0.5 release includes contributions from [kennyyork], [natecook1000],
[sgl0v], and [YuAo]. Thank you!

## [0.0.4] - 2020-03-23

### Fixes

- Removed usage of 5.2-only syntax.

## [0.0.3] - 2020-03-22

### Additions

- You can specify the `.unconditionalRemaining` parsing strategy for arrays of
  positional arguments to accept dash-prefixed input, like
  `example --one two -three`.
- You can now provide a default value for a positional argument.
- You can now customize the display of default values in the extended help for
  an `ExpressibleByArgument` type.
- You can call the static `exitCode(for:)` method on any command to retrieve the
  exit code for a given error.

### Fixes

- Supporting targets are now prefixed to prevent conflicts with other libraries.
- The extension providing `init?(argument:)` to `RawRepresentable` types is now
  properly constrained.
- The parser no longer treats passing the same exclusive flag more than once as
  an error.
- `ParsableArguments` types that are declared as `@OptionGroup()` properties on
  commands can now also be declared on subcommands. Previosuly, the parent 
  command's declaration would prevent subcommands from seeing the user-supplied 
  arguments.
- Default values are rendered correctly for properties with `Optional` types.
- The output of help requests is now printed during the "exit" phase of execution, 
  instead of during the "run" phase.
- Usage strings now correctly show that optional positional arguments aren't 
  required.
- Extended help now omits extra line breaks when displaying arguments or commands
  with long names that don't provide help text.

The 0.0.3 release includes contributions from [compnerd], [elliottwilliams],
[glessard], [griffin-stewie], [iainsmith], [Lantua], [miguelangel-dev],
[natecook1000], [sjavora], and [YuAo]. Thank you!

## [0.0.2] - 2020-03-06

### Additions

- The `EX_USAGE` exit code is now used for validation errors.
- The parser provides near-miss suggestions when a user provides an unknown
  option.
- `ArgumentParser` now builds on Windows.
- You can throw an `ExitCode` error to exit without printing any output.
- You can now create optional Boolean flags with inversions that default to 
  `nil`:
  ```swift
  @Flag(inversion: .prefixedNo) var takeMyShot: Bool?
  ```
- You can now specify exclusivity for case-iterable flags and for Boolean flags
  with inversions.

### Fixes

- Cleaned up a wide variety of documentation typos and shortcomings.
- Improved different kinds of error messages:
  - Duplicate exclusive flags now show the duplicated arguments.
  - Subcommand validation errors print the correct usage string.
- In the help screen:
  - Removed the extra space before the default value for arguments without
    descriptions.
  - Removed the default value note when the default value is an empty string.
  - Default values are now shown for Boolean options.
  - Case-iterable flags are now grouped correctly.
  - Case-iterable flags with default values now show the default value.
  - Arguments from parent commands that are included via `@OptionGroup` in 
    subcommands are no longer duplicated.
- Case-iterable flags created with the `.chooseFirst` exclusivity parameter now 
  correctly ignore additional flags.

The 0.0.2 release includes contributions from [AliSoftware], [buttaface], 
[compnerd], [dduan], [glessard], [griffin-stewie], [IngmarStein], 
[jonathanpenn], [klaaspieter], [natecook1000], [Sajjon], [sjavora], 
[Wildchild9], and [zntfdr]. Thank you!

## [0.0.1] - 2020-02-27

- `ArgumentParser` initial release.
